 I wanted to use this assignment as an excuse to talk about an aspect of videogame storytelling that I find intriguing. 

 when creating both a compelling story and style of gamplay, game developers can often overlook a crucial narrative rule. 
 <br>This rule is called **Ludonarrative Dissonance**:
*the conflict between a video game's narrative told through the non-interactive elements and the narrative told through the gameplay.* [1]

This hurdle is something unique to games, as other narrative methods (film, literature)
