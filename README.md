 I wanted to use this assignment as an excuse to talk about an aspect of videogame storytelling that I find intriguing. 

 when creating both a compelling story and style of gamplay, game developers can often overlook a crucial narrative rule of story cohesion. 
 <br>Having gameplay options and actions that interact with your story is called a ***ludo narrative***. When done well, it is called *Ludonarrative cohesion*, and when done poorly is aptly named *Ludonarrative Dissonance*.
 
 <br> **Ludonarrative Dissonance**:
*the conflict between a video game's narrative told through the non-interactive elements and the narrative told through the gameplay.* [1]

This hurdle is something unique to games, as other narrative methods (film, literature) have their audiences statically locked into one form of interaction, either watching or reading for themselves. in no other medium do you have your audience hear your story, see the characters, and then have the option to make the character choose a completely unintended course of action. 

Though challenging to plan around, it is incredibly important for game creators to get their narrative choices aligned, otherwise the "*reall-ness*" or player buy-in will suffer a severe and abrupt drop-off.
A great example of a game with excellent narrative cohesion is the 2020 supergiant game ***Hades*** [2].

## Why it works:
Upon release, Hades was an unexpected hit, garnering massive amounts of attention and praise. But why did this game leave such a strong impression on it's players? The game had impassioned script writers, committed musicians, and stunning visuals for sure, but the aspecgt that seemed to stick in players minds was the narrative. and not just that the narrative was good, though to be fair it was incredible, but the fact that player actions were not separate from the narrative, but *woven into it*. 

Hades is classified as a *Rogue-like* or *Rogue-lite*, which are identified by their *death and restart* mechanics. As this is a common category for videogames, it is often overlooked and seen as separate from the story being told. Choosing to see the mechanics of your genre as mearly a method of player input can be short sighted and leave you isolated from creativity within that method. 

The devs of Hades did not overlook this oppertunity for creativity, instead integrating the *death and rebirth* cycles of rogue-like games into their story's core theme. The playable character Zagreus, in an attempt to escape the Grecian underworld, dies over and over again, only to be thrust into life again at the bottom of Hades. 
Because both the gameplay and narrative are so seamlessly intertwined, players felt more invested in the game and enthusiastically spent hours perfecting their techniques and playstyles. Their efforts seemed to have more weight compared to other games because the characters, mechanics, and world were impacted in notable ways based on their skill and attention. 

Having narrative cohesion, or avoiding narrative dissonance, seems to embolden players to commit fully to the game, no longer fearing if their efforts will be noticed. 

I would write more, but I do not want to give you, dear reader, a novel. 
Thank you for your time! I hope you are mindful when picking up your next game and asking yourself "Are my actions in line with the story?"
